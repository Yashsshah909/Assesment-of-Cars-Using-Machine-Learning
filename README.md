# Assesment-of-Cars-Using-machine-Learning
The number of car accidents in the United States
equates to about 5.25 million yearly. A few of the many reasons
for a car accident can be driver’s impairment or behavior, a
failure of some system in the car and others. Some of these can
be easily avoided by simply evaluating the car’s safety and regular
maintenance of the car. Machine learning can help evaluate the
safety of a car using the concept of classification to determine if
a given car is safe enough to drive.
The machine learning algorithm that this paper is referring
to is classification trees. Classification trees aim to divide the
data into smaller data sets on which the prediction models can
work to give much better results as compared to running the
prediction models on the entire data. This paper proposes the
use of the decision trees classification model for assessing cars.
An in-depth analysis of this model will be considered, advantages
and disadvantages will be explored. Along with this, it will also
look at some methods to how this model can be improved further
for better results. Finally, it will discover which features of the
car are most and least important for judging if it is good enough
according to the standards of a car.
